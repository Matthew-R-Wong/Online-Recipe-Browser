This is some extra information I forgot to specifically state in the video:

If there is no text in the text file or no recipe is selected, such as at the very start of running the program, the edit recipe, delete recipe,
and toggle tags buttons will just instantly return when pressed. Basically making them do nothing until a recipe is selected, and not returning
any errors.

Additionally, any information put into the add recipe or edit recipe boxes will be disregarded and the boxes cleared if the user closes the window
by x-ing out of it instead of pressing the finish button at the bottom. This is so if a user realizes they don't want to make the addition or edits
they put in they can easily get out of doing so. As such, the text file is only written on to save when the user finalizes adding, editing, or deleting
a recipe.

Also all of the information shown is inside of tkinter frames. These are essentially boxes inside of each other, specifically ordered and sized to achieve the
final look that I intended to.

I could not find any times that python would throw a logical error in the final iteration of my code as tried my absolute best to account for every possible
error that might occur. I am sure that there might be one or two that I may have missed because the tkinter framing and coding got incredibly complicated towards the end. However, I am confident any errors there may be would not stop the program from running.
